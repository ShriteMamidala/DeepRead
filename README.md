#  DeepRead – Bias Detection for the Modern Web

---

##  Inspiration

As online content shapes public opinion, the presence of subtle bias—racial, gender, political, or otherwise—has a growing impact. **DeepRead** was built to help users identify and reduce bias in written language, making digital spaces more fair and inclusive.

## 🛠️ What It Does

**DeepRead** is a web application that:
-  Detects bias in text across multiple categories (racial, gender, political, age-based, etc.)
-  Highlights biased words or phrases and suggests neutral alternatives
-  Includes a **Rewriter Tool** to auto-rephrase biased content
-  Offers an interactive **“Beat the Bias”** game to help users learn through play

## ⚙️ How It Works

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI)
- **AI Models**: Custom-trained and Fine-Tuned machine learning models such as BERT for detecting and categorizing bias in text
- **APIs**: HTTP requests for model inference and rewriter functionality

## 📝 Notes

> DeepRead is an educational tool and should be used as a **guide**—not a definitive judge—when evaluating bias in writing. Language is complex, and context matters!
